	<h3 class="post-title">Intro To Economics</h3>
	<br />
    <p> When I was taking my first introductory calculus classes I was curious to know, like most students, about "real-world" applications of this amazing thing I'd spent so much time learning. My professor at the time handed me <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Techniques-Optimization-Microeconomic-Applications/dp/9812774939">Calculus and Techniques of Optimization with Microeconomic Applications</a> by Dr. Hoag from <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu">BGSU</a>, which ignited my curiosity in economics. From there, my knowledge of economics and mathematics seemed to play off one another which spurred another great interest in mathematical economics.</p>
	<p> Going back a little further, I remember sitting in an introductory college algebra class being asked to solve for crossing points of a seemingly random function and asking "Where or how do they get the values in front of the variables?" It was only after working seriously on my mathematics degree that I learned about statistical regression analysis, and quickly realized how someone could "get those values in front of the variables..." I've been in love with econometrics ever since, and have my sights set on doctoral programs focusing in it.</p>
	<br />
	<h3 class="post-title">Film Major Turned Mathematician</h3>
	<br />
	<p> A requirement for a Associate's Degree from Portland Community College is completing four credits of a math electives. By chance, I wound up taking an introductory college algebra class from one of my favorite teachers so far, Forrest Carter. The way the material was presented was so fascinating that I decided to take another math class (trigonometry) purely for fun. After I finished trigonometry, Forrest urged me to take calculus. That's the thing about mathematics though, everytime I research an interesting topic I find five more and feel my curiosity peek again. I like to think of myself as a mathematician who got distracted by how wonderful economics can be.</p>
	<br />
	<h3 class="post-title">Schools of Economic Thought</h3>
	<br />
	<p> Economics majors are required to take a class about the <a href="http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2018-2019/Bulletin/Courses/Ec-Economics/400/Ec-460">history of economic thought</a> in order to complete their degrees at Portland State University. At the time I was really interested in economic growth and international development, and I decided to work on the history of growth theory, writing about how the Stockholm school of economic thought directly influenced and advanced the basic tenants of economic growth theory in the neoclassical framework. Gustav Cassell was a fascinating economist to study, and I ended up reading several of his books during the project. </p>
	<br />
	<p> More recently, I've been studying the Austrian school and Friedrich Hayek in particular. I was introduced to Hayek by a similar study of Milton Friedman and classical liberalism, which was sparked by a reassesment of my personal political philosphy. My background in environmental economic topics goes against strict <em>laissez-faire</em> systems common to the Austrian School, and reconciling this with classical liberalism has been an interesting and rewarding dive into political philosophy.</p>
